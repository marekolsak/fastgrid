New Features

Improved performance

FastGrid is the new fork of AutoGrid, which is 100% compatible
with AutoGrid 4.2.1. FastGrid is optimized to fully leverage
the power of multi-core processors and NVIDIA graphics hardware.
It is approximately 50 times faster in common scenarios and this
may go even higher as the size of gridmap or the number of atoms
in the macromolecule increases. For large gridmaps, it is possible
to achieve increase in performance by a factor of 300.

In case NVIDIA GeForce 8xxx or later graphics hardware is not
present, FastGrid will still be more than N times faster, where N
is the number of processor cores.

Large gridmaps and macromolecules

FastGrid can calculate much larger gridmaps than AutoGrid.
The maximum allowed size of gridmap has been changed from 128x128x128
to 1024x1024x1024 on both Linux and Windows.

The maximum number of atoms in the macromolecule is now limited by
the size of available memory instead of being specified by a fixed
value.
